 Anyone want to volunteer to pair with Albert after lunch (RoR)?  Devmotron image me Not it  http://images1.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20120915012607/community-sitcom/images/thumb/c/cc/RCT-Not_it.png/800px-RCT-Not_it.png#.png  :)  Don't everyone jump at once.  I'll do it  somewhat fresh in my mind ;)  devmotron image me thank you  http://www.theprospect.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Thank-you.jpg#.png  Devmotron image me You da man  http://static.fjcdn.com/large/pictures/e0/2a/e02ace_1618716.jpg#.png  #fail?  how is the 'deleted' attribute on T_Requests used?  here a Co-op we should hire in 12 years http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6fKs3Zbnb0  That's pretty awesome  Although, if I ever have kids I'm just going to force them to churn out Rails apps for extra money, they don't get to do anything cool or fun  "Arduino is cool sun, but you know what's even more fun? Pay roll management crud apps! Now back to work"  son*  There seems to be a phone number near the top of the dev wiki: https://intranet.covermymeds.com/dev/_layouts/15/start.aspx#/Dev%20Wiki/  that seems to be our fax number  Yep, I put that there, so I can open a new window, it auto-loads the devwiki, and then I can double-click and copy the fax and paste it into forms.   About to head to the office.  here you go Derek  http://img.pandawhale.com/post-18810-Sprockets-dance-gif-OFu5.gif  hypnotic yet terrifying  Looks like he had to leave the room after that  fyi i will not be in tomorrow  Albert's making good progress but could use a few extra min to get his timer save working correctly.  I'm thinking 4:30  Not that it's a huge deal, but I'm going to have to cut out at a bit after 5 for some family stuff.  that's a pretty huge deal Derek  devmotron image me huge deal  http://static6.businessinsider.com/image/5081511369bedd073300000e/top-security-official-killed-in-lebanon-bombing-and-its-a-huge-deal.jpg#.png  wow that pic sums it up  Our request key format has a magnitude of 11.5 million and currently there are just over 8 million PA requests. Do we have a plan to extend it?  It's already changed once so some of those 8 million are using the old format.  Do you know what the proportion is?  No  I'd guess less then 3 million using the old format.  Letters and number were switched so the keyspace was smaller.  And we ran out.  I vote for a 64 character UUID  future proof!  It would still need a mapping to something short and typeable  Users type it out at the enter key page  :trollface:  yeah it's unfortunate that the ID is actually visible/used by users  Anyone know if CMM2_Staging has been recently updated? I'm getting the wonderful XML Form descriptoin missing page  devmotron animate me show time  http://www.freewarepocketpc.net/software_images/showtime-watcher.1.gif#.png  WTF?  devmotron animate me game time  http://www.nomorekings.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/MagicalGameTime2.gif#.png  I give up  lol  worth a shot!  devmotron animate me developers developers developers  http://behance.vo.llnwd.net/profiles17/2314555/projects/7510761/d49258cf6c7b09b81929ee47726c5018.gif#.png  #fail  oh  no devmotron  there it is  lame  demvotron image me epic failure  well then  lol  Boyan: in case you check the transcript later: requests_api will be changing the request id format again to double the keyspace.  currently: #AA#AA, requests_api: AA#AA#  then, at some point later we plan use AA#AA#AA, which should work forever*  * don't quote me  These plans are all with Bruce's guidance, btw.  Heading to the Columbus Business First luncheon soon to find out that we're one of the best places to work and watch Ben Way accept an award :)  :D   woot  http://i.stack.imgur.com/GwRYd.jpg  http://stackoverflow.com/questions/209905/representational-state-transfer-rest-and-simple-object-access-protocol-soap  haha!  what a great infographic  So…with REST I send Martin Lawrence to my server.  The benefits are clear~!  exactly!  If anyone hasn't seen Subelksy's Guide to Staying Good and Fast When Making Enterprise Software, it's cool: http://www.subelsky.com/2013/11/staying-fast-and-good-when-making.html?utm_content=buffer29b00&utm_source=buffer&utm_medium=twitter&utm_campaign=Buffer&m=1  step 1, don't have crappy code base  We're getting close to a lot of these things, but some things (our "cluster immune system") need work.  I would like a cluster immune system  I'm envisioning some mad scientist standing next to our server rack with a comically large hypodermic needle  I like the feature flags idea  Once everything is clustered I like the idea of enabling features one node at a time to live 'test' too  Feature flags seems like a really good idea.  Having the full-on "is data moving through the system properly" overview would also be cool, but for that we'd need to map out all the nodes/edges in our graph.  I have to step out for a bit, should be back within an hour  Every time I see Ryan B. I think Ryan Bates...  Is anyone staging on autobahn?  FYI y'all, the masquerading changes are complicated and time consuming to test, if you need to use staging for cmm/dashboard/autobahn that's cool just let me know so we know to rebase and restage  The feature flag concept works great when used hand-in-hand with a well thought out roles/permissions security system. New features have a specific security permission(s) that exposes it. For deployment and testing, only a select few have the permission so it can be fully deployed to production. When it is time to release, simply add that permission to the various groups that are supposed to have the feature and it's done.  You can get a lot of the benefit without all that though  For instance: new feature in CMM_PHP? Turn it on for operators and off for everyone else. Get some production testing in place, then remove the `if` blocks from the code and deploy.   Is anyone actively on Santiago at the moment? We're (Graham and I) trying to test the behavior of this Pinglish stuff and need to stop SQL for a min  Devmotron image me crickets  http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b7/Snodgrass_Gryllus_assimilis.png#.png  NO SANTIAGO FOR ME  Ok, well… he goes and hope for no screams  For those who don’t know, PNaCl was recently integrated into Chrome 31 beta, giving developers the ability to execute native code in the browser.  AAAAAHHHHH  http://thenextweb.com/google/2013/11/12/google-launches-portable-native-client-lets-developers-compile-code-run-hardware-site/  Phosphorus and salt?  Supposedly "(P)ortable (Na)tive (Cl)ient"  and pronounced pinnacle  I'm having active x flashbacks  I like the idea of asm.js more  the demos I've seen have been super impressive, and cross-browser to boot  I don't think they're really comparable  I think the goal of asm is to be fast  whereas the goal of pnakclkcl is to allow you to write 'native' apps that can run inside chrome  isn't the goal the same, though? to embed performant applications  I suppose you could consider them to have the same goal, if you ignore the fact that google's answer is just a way to get other languages than javascript supported in only their browser.  I guess I look at them going in opposite directions  asm wants you to be able to write fast javascript everywhere  whereas pancaacl wants you to be able to write anything but javascript in the browser  Miss breakfast Chad? You seem to be thinking about pancakes or leaning that way?  mmmmm pancakes  Isn't it breakfast time in WA?  I'll start calling it T_PAAMAYIM_NEKUDOTAYIM  OR  Chad: that shit gives me some horrible flashbacks  trigger warning next time  Chad, that's the next table name in the CMM database  🍳  to be fair, it is one of the most easily googleable errors ever  If Google's answer is a way to get other languages to run in the browser does that mean that Microsoft was way ahead of the curve by letting you execute VB in IE5 and 6?  Google is the new Microsoft  it kinda is...  Yeah only a lot.  I can still use firefox on my android at least  which is more than I can say for Windows PHone  Maybe we're locked in a perpetual cycle of Apple vs MEGACO  Now that google/android seems to be relegating apple back to minor player status  and then in the future apple will once again rise from the also ran status to take on google  and then google will shrink and IBM will rise to power to put apple back down  I may have had too much coffee this morning  I cannot imagine an IBM-designed smartphone.   what, with ThinkPad design language?  that would be boss  If it were 1998, sure ;)  instead of a touchscreen it has a trackpoint  Devmotron: image me hackers 1995  http://www.the-nextlevel.com/tnl/attachment.php?attachmentid=61762&d=1306042486#.png  hoards of neckbeards claim that it's a more precise input method  hack the planet!  That should ABSOLUTELY be a devmotron command :D  honestly 6 years ago who could have imagined a google designed smartphone? or a firefox one? or an ubuntu one? The future is wide open!  It's fun living in the future  I used to swear by the ThinkPad nipple  It is more appealing if you refer to it as a nipple  7th grade Graham's mind agreed  lawl  If only Apple would carry on the torch and implement one, but call it a Magic Nipple like the Magic Trackpad  Magic Nubbin  You could pick different colored nipples as well  #covermymeds -- keeping it NSFW since 2008.  http://xkcd.com/243/  devmotron image me xkcd 243  http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/images/d/d0/connected.png#.png  not quite  need the xkcd module  so I'm working on ripping the guts out of CMM_PHP's faxing code  there's a bit in here that creates a failure notification email, one for regular users, and one for Navinet users  I was under the impression that we don't have email addresses for Navinet users, is that correct?  My hero :fax: :heart:  some of them have emails in the database  Nathan, I'd focus first on just taking a request ID and faxing the form with an option to do just the coversheet or the full form  Let whatever is calling the fax function deal with failures and such  If we have a test Partners user in production, can we also have that user in staging?  Vasanth, we do have a test Partners account.  But it targets staging.covermymeds.com not navinet.covermymeds.com from what I recall  Hm, well when I log in as phc_ct721, I'm taken to www.covermymeds.com  Are you logging into their staging site?  Their staging site gives me an error;  ah, so I logged into their prod site  After clicking CMM icon:  I really want to see a graph diagram of the IRS' phone tree  I got made it to 11 levels deep before I just stopped hitting buttons and waited for it to send me to a person  then it put me on hold with an esimated 15+ minute wait  how busy can the IRS be in november?!?!?!  Does anyone have the towing company information for the Weisheimer lot?  I am planning on informing Albert of our decision (no) later this afternoon. If anyone has any second thoughts, please stop by.  Warner: Mary probably does. Why?  ahh hope you didn't get towed :(  Mary's gone.  I did. :\  Oh boo :( Sorry dude.  I have Mary's number, can give her a ring real quick.  I'd try the impound lot  (614) 645-6400  That one was my fault. That's what being in a hurry gets. Thanks, guys.  I can't imagine where else they would tow it  Get a Chevy Captiva  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfuA0JVAx6M  warner: you want I should give her a call?  err Equinox maybe..  would not recommend buying a chevy  Ohhh, that sucks. To be honest, I'd feel worse about some tow truck driver tugging a BMW of mine around vs. my truck getting broken into.  what you should do is buy a tow truck  because who would tow a tow truck?  Leonardo DiCaprio. I hear they're shooting Inception 2 already  :scream:  http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3475/3394594530_6ec9bc589a.jpg  Xzibit, just never gets old  Hey folks, I gotta run a bit early today. I'll be online at home.  see ya  Mary hit me up, thanks guys.  Do you need someone to help you to retrieve your car Warner?  Just looking for more opportunities to volunteer Graham for things  What about Larry? Now he's the new guy.  I wonder how much it costs to rent a tow truck and tow theirs  lol, I see how it is guys  Just be glad we are not the Miami Dolphins ;-)  right!!  Dinner will be a little cheaper for us Rookie  Raman?  Profane texts to follow...  Canady's drinking tab though, you may want to check out Payday Loans  I'm going to follow Canady out early today and be back online later. Hopefully the mass exodus from the parking lot hasn't begun yet.  Yeah, why was it so packed?  Convention center doin' what it does I suppose  How would I go about figuring out how to get more information on what the red-highlighted double right chevron is worried about?  Maybe you have a plugin that checks indentation?   Vasanth: if that was in Vim using Syntastic, put your cursor on the line and look at the status line at the bottom.  Vasanth does it have anything to do with the fact that you don't have a 'end' for your if condition?  I love this. Programmers discussing the merits of various tools/plugins  The test engineer sees the syntactical issue with the code.  ;)   I saw last night that CRB is still looking for speakers for Monday.  Last time there weren't enough speakers we did a fish bowl, and ppl talked about their feelings…..If you've been toying with something this week is your time to shine!  lol @ "and ppl talked about their feelings"  Hey I love soft talks. Not to the 100% exclusion of tech stuff, I mean it's a Ruby meetup after all, but still. Soft talks is cool.  Jon, let's start a soft talks/hugging meetup  no one leaves without a hug  I like hugs too!   WHO DOESN'T LIKE HUGS?   :)  And beacuse I just saw it and thought of Graham:  https://scontent-a-sjc.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ash3/s403x403/1396062_586024128114105_2000481235_n.jpg  Haha that's awesome!  Jon C.: The status line did show an explanation for the marking; thanks. Justin R.: Initially I did have two ends, and it still marked it up (whether or not there were two ends or one didn't seem to make a difference); but now, I'm not sure why, it is working.  vp: syntastic runs on save. perhaps you didn't save to see the change?  Hm, no, I definitely saved with :w. I tried to reproduce it, but could not. However, it might be related to this new situation: whether or not I put an 'end' on line 122, Syntastic doesn't mind either way:  What does is_nf in T_Requests signify?  no fun  :trollface:  Would this be indication that formulary drugs were not effective and a request is for non formulary drugs?  It does mean "non formulary"  anyone know anything about the RepairController in CMM_PHP?  first of all, wut?  second of all, can I delete it?  Just comment it all out  haha!  don't do that  it's mostly commented out already  Past developers are already off to a good start  so it looks like a public-accessible controller to re-send faxes  CMM is a graveyard of dead code  but without doing some static code analysis who knows what is actually dead  I wonder if we could take all of the dead code and make a spin off app  I was curious if Chad or Ryan have ever used any of these methods  Also we're not calling it dead code, it's "incremental progress"  https://git.innova-partners.com/cmm/CMM_PHP/commit/63ef87996dea40e578fcaf47ec7dc9ab12ee8e7b  There are probably 2 people in this world who know why RepairController exists and if it is really necessary  ok, so looks like it was last touched by sziegler, 2 years ago  I'ma ditch it  you could always grep the production logs for the actions that are still uncommented  good call  there are other controllers and actions that are dead too  I've taken an out of sight out of mind strategy  I remove anything that's already commented out  but if it's still there I try to ignore it because you never know what insanity may still use something  doing some refactoring, and there's a method Faxer::issueNotificationMail  moved other emails to be sent with Postmaster  but there's one remaining place where it's called, the RepairController  oh man, such a rabbit hole  yep  eddie's design philosophy was that everything goes in a model, controller, sprocket or big old utility class.  Alright Chad, round #2 for CMM trivia  MonitorController?  I'll take The Rapists for $200 Nathan  that looks like something used before pingdom  or used with pingdom  I might ask chip if we have anything that checks statuses at those endpoints anymore  and of course grep the log files  all those methods use some sort of opaque stored proc  there is nothing like a static status output  all systems nominal!  no no, the system monitor is nominal  it says nothing about the system itself  hahaha!  I think we can imply what the system status is  fubar  man, this is great  searching the codebase to find where certain methods are used  2 places  where they are declared  and TestController  I have pretty much only ever worked on AjaxController, AsyncController, RequestController, SignupController and UserController. For all I know the dozen other ones are dead. But I'd say 90% of current CMM functionality is through those 5 controllers.  Rumor is, Chrome may soon replace IE8 as the default browser at OSU med ctr  that would be pretty sweet  You guys check out that skateboarding video? Freakin' impressive.  which one?  Pretty cool, hopefully his coding is on the same level :)  The guy coming in for lunch on Friday  oh, nah I didn't see it  Just checked it out. That was pretty sweet.  uh so the CMM apache log is 2GB  advisable to download or just grep in place?  open it with textedit  Can we build a halfpipe in the office somewhere? I probably won't pick up skateboarding, but I'll go after it with a bike  ms word  MS Notepad rulz all  real men use sed  grep in place sounds like a rubygem  gem install grep_in_place  ~> 1.0.0  grep in place.  On what server?  print it and go through with a highlighter  Graham FTW. ;)  I do have an *erasable* Anthem BlueCross BlueShield highlighter. That way when you're done you can erase all your highlights so that someone else can go through the logs later  That should be part of the code day  I will be leaving a bit early today.  I have to be home by 3.  oops  :congrats:!  I lol'd  Nice tie!  http://exumatech.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/tie-wall.jpg  Source: http://exumatech.com/blog/how-strong-culture-drives-profits-at-zappos/  Delivering Happiness was worth the read  This is going to make me sound like a  grump…but why do articles about "great places to work" always picture people who aren't working?  Great work place == interesting work == people actively working.  </rant>  https://www.olark.com/about  More people not working  (scroll down to treehouse)  Yesterday the keynote speech included a workplace video that was a song they wrote about how fun their work is. Needless to say, nobody was working  Treehouse > stock photo of corporate models  How about some corporate models in a tree house?  Hm, I think I'm sold.  I'm glad our promo videos aren't this  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QhBGcIj7ho0  omg  the intro is so long  Best way to convey a point? AUTOTUNE  "forget about the money let me tell you 'bout the perks" -- translation: you get paid shit but you work with fun people who also get paid shit.  anyone know about followup faxes?  I know like historical context (maybe) but not much beyond that  trying to see how they can be triggered from the UI  as far as I can see, they are "fire and forget"  just trying to confirm w/ someone who actually knows what a "followup fax" is  Central's cukes are the fastest evar  Ended a week before we began running them!   Very nice!  It must be estimating time the same way my previous PM did  Ha, just saw this  http://i.imgur.com/2A3ihEW.gif  LOL  pretty awesome  Dude's a born manager  Looks like somebody's kids from the party. Maybe Kent has been teaching his how to git?  for those who aren't aware: https://twitter.com/gitlost  It would be nice if binding.pry can be more specific about child elements the way inspect element can be:  instead of displaying less-than-helpful data like this:  I'd say it's the responsibility of Watir implementers to set the format their objects are displayed in at the console
